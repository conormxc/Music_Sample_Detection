# Music_Sample_Detection

Please note the code is unmaintained and for demonstrative purposes only. However, please feel free to reach out if you are interested in the projects functionality or the data I have collected.

Specifically, the project involves scraping the website whosampled.com to create a dataset of songs which sample the Amen break and songs which didn't. Links to these songs where downloaded and converted into spectrograms, then fed into a classifier built off of the vggish model.

For the process and results of this project please find a presentation here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KqGTs53OIBCwW6TQNDiuWT25ja5xqlsD/view?usp=sharing
